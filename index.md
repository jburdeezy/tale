Hi, I'm Justin. I'm a product and technology guy from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Currently, I lead product at [Jetpack Workflow](http://www.jetpackworkflow.com) as their Product Manager. Previously, I've worked at [Nowait](http://www.nowait.com), which was [acquired by Yelp in 2016](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/01/yelp-picks-up-restaurant-waitlist-app-nowait-for-40-million/), and [WebKite](http://www.webkite.com), another startup in the Pittsburgh area. I'm also an alumnus of the [AlphaLab](http://www.alphalab.org) incubator program.

I live with my wife, [Kate](http://www.katiepunkin.com), and our daughter, Jemma, who was born in January 2017. In my (relatively little) spare time, I like to tinker with technology and play games, especially Magic: the Gathering.
